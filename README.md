## Overview
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Object detection enables machines to understand visual data by identifying objects in images and videos.

This project integrates the YOLOv3 model with OpenCV to:
- Detect multiple objects in a single image
- Label them with bounding boxes
- Display real-time output with confidence scores

</details>

## 🎯 Problem Statement
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

While cameras generate large volumes of visual data, much of it remains unused without intelligent systems. Traditional detection systems:
- Don't scale well
- Perform poorly in real-time
- Struggle with lighting/occlusion

</details>

## 💡 Proposed Solution
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

We built a Python-based system that:
- Uses YOLOv3 with OpenCV
- Detects objects with high accuracy
- Processes real-time camera input
- Outputs labeled bounding boxes

</details>

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy
- **Model:** YOLOv3 (pre-trained on COCO dataset)
- **Frameworks:** cv2.dnn module (for inference)

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-yolo
cd object-detection-yolo

# Install dependencies
pip install opencv-python numpy

# Download YOLOv3 files
# 1. yolov3.weights: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
# 2. yolov3.cfg: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg
# 3. coco.names: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names
```
## Usage🖱️
```bash
import cv2

# Load YOLO
net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov3.weights", "yolov3.cfg")
with open("coco.names", "r") as f:
    classes = f.read().strip().split("\n")

layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers().flatten()]

# Load image
img = cv2.imread("sample.jpg")
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(img, 1/255.0, (416, 416), swapRB=True, crop=False)
net.setInput(blob)

# Forward pass
outputs = net.forward(output_layers)

# Post-process: draw boxes, labels
# (You can add your drawing and filtering logic here)
```
