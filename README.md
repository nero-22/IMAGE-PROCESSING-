## Overview
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Object detection enables machines to understand visual data by identifying objects in images and videos.

This project integrates the YOLOv3 model with OpenCV to:
- Detect multiple objects in a single image
- Label them with bounding boxes
- Display real-time output with confidence scores

</details>

## 🎯 Problem Statement
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

While cameras generate large volumes of visual data, much of it remains unused without intelligent systems. Traditional detection systems:
- Don't scale well
- Perform poorly in real-time
- Struggle with lighting/occlusion

</details>

## 💡 Proposed Solution
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

We built a Python-based system that:
- Uses YOLOv3 with OpenCV
- Detects objects with high accuracy
- Processes real-time camera input
- Outputs labeled bounding boxes

</details>

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy
- **Model:** YOLOv3 (pre-trained on COCO dataset)
- **Frameworks:** cv2.dnn module (for inference)
